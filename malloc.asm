; DynMem is organized into chunks. Each chunk consists of a length,
; an owner and a data range. A chunk can be between 2 and 256 bytes.
; Length is of the whole structure, not just the usable data.
RSRESET
; Chunk length including header. Special cases: 0 means 256 (254 bytes of data),
; 1 is a sentinel value meaning end-of-DynMem-range.
chunk_len rb 1
; Owner task_id, or 255 to indicate no owner.
chunk_owner rb 1
; Data itself, variable length
chunk_data rb 0
